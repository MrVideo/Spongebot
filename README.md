# Spongebot
A Discord bot made with Python that converts strings to SPonGETexT

You can use [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=899379418261258291&permissions=534723950656&scope=bot) to invite it to your server.

## Commands

The bot's prefix is ``?``. I will be adding a way to change it in the future.

* ``?sponge <string>``: converts the input string into spongetext and deletes your message
