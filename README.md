# Spongebot

A Discord bot made with Python that converts strings to SPonGETexT.

As of 10 April 2023, this repository is archived. The bot's codebase was migrated to JavaScript to take advantage of new features like slash commands.

You can find the new bot [here](https://github.com/MrVideo/spongebot.js).

## Commands

The bot's prefix is ``?``. I will be adding a way to change it in the future.

* ``?sponge <string>``: converts the input string into spongetext and deletes your message
* ``?help``: sends an embed containing the command list to the user
